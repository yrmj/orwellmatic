# orwellmatic
Removes authors you do not like from the front page of the Guardian's website and replaces them with George Orwell. Originally created to make the run-up to the Brexit referendum bearable, but may have wider applications. Tested on Firefox with Greasemonkey, but should work with Chrome and Tampermonkey too. Open orwellize.user.js -> Raw -> Install -> enjoy.
